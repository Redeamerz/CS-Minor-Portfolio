## ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).

One or more ALUs load data from input registers to accomplish the majority of a CPU's operations. A register is a little piece of storage that comes with a CPU. The ALU is told what operation to do on the data by the control unit, and the result is stored in an output register by the ALU. The data is moved between these registers, the ALU, and memory by the control unit.

### Energy consumption with ALU


## Factorial origins calculations

## Diffie Hellman

## Power usage for decrypting passwords low when has key, yet lot of effort without key

## freq distribution

## AES + block cipher

## 3DES

## Rijndaal block cipher

## AES algorithm process

## Block cipher based CBC (Cipher Block chaining)

## ESSIV

## CMM (Cipher block chaining) message authentication

## CMM Integrity to confidentiality

## Galios/counter mode: adds authentication to CBC

## GCM: more efficiency and adds integrity to confidentiality

## AES against bruteforce
