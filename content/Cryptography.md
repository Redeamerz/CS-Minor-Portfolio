## ALU in relation to cryptography

### Energy consumption with ALU

## Factorial origins calculations

## Diffie Hellman

## Power usage for decrypting passwords low when has key, yet lot of effort without key

## freq distribution

## AES + block cipher

## 3DES

## Rijndaal block cipher

## AES algorithm process

## Block cipher based CBC (Cipher Block chaining)

## ESSIV

## CMM (Cipher block chaining) message authentication

## CMM Integrity to confidentiality

## Galios/counter mode: adds authentication to CBC

## GCM: more efficiency and adds integrity to confidentiality

## AES against bruteforce
