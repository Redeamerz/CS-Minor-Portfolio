title: MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
---

Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a security mechanism that needs two different forms of identification to gain access to something.

Two-factor authentication can be used to make an online account, a
smartphone, or even a door more secure. Before anything that is being
secured may be accessed, 2FA requires two forms of information from the
user a password or personal identification number (PIN), a code given to
the user's smartphone, or a fingerprint.

## Pros and Cons of 2FA

### Pros

#### Second layer of security

This is a self-evident statement, but it is also the most apparent benefit
of using a two-factor authentication solution. While a password has been
the standard security method for almost as long as accounts have been required to be kept private in the digital age, it only provides one layer of protection.

When a password is discovered, it is considered a security breach. Strong
passwords have been advised for a long time, typically comprising a
combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, but they are
still only one kind of security.

Furthermore, more secure methods of accessing personal information, such as a speech recognition device, are only one layer that must be
compromised [[3]](#references).

#### Variation

Only if you use a second password the same way as the first will you
see a 100 percent increase in security levels. On the other hand, two-factor authentication usually combines the authentication systems you use,
resulting in much higher security levels.

Other methods of achieving this, such as intrinsic authentication, which
uses a physical property to identify you, are available in addition to
using mobile devices to transmit on a security key (a tried-and-true
two-factor authentication approach)[[2][3]](#references).

#### Cost-effective

In general, two-factor authentication methods are not expensive. If you
add retinal scanning or voice recognition as a second step. The price will
rise, but advances in these techniques mean that you can now use these
types of hardware systems at relatively low costs[[3]](#references).

### Cons

#### Time

Everything is relative when it comes to time. So, while the time it takes
to access accounts using a two-factor authentication process, maybe
negligible in terms of capacity for many, for others, such as using a card
reader each time, it would be a wasteful process that, when multiplied by
the number of employees would equate to inefficient use of time.

Some two-factor authentication systems, such as SMS, are faster to
implement than others, so thorough research is advised if this is a
concern. A two-step process will always take longer for the second step,
so a two-step authentication system is unnecessary for data or accounts
that isn't important[[2][3]](#references).

#### It's not foolproof

The reality is that no security system is foolproof â€“ that is the nature
of the cyber landscape right now. Two-factor authentication processes are undoubtedly more effective than one-factor systems, that much is evident, but determined hackers can still implement any number of devious schemes and malware threats to undermine your system and access your sensitive data.

That is not an easy feat to accomplish. The methods for circumventing or
breaching two-factor authentication systems will vary depending on several factors, including the type of authentication system you use, as some are more effective than others. But while a password, for example, can be inadvertently shared, the same cannot be said of inherent recognition in two-step authentication.

Cybercriminals have developed increasingly devious, underhand yet
sophisticated hardware to copy this information to steal data and access
accounts. Recent posts onh6ne show 2fa is far more secure than the
alternatives; however, nothing is foolproof regarding cybersecurity[[2][3]](#references).

#### Cost

While relative to the organization, inevitably, a two-factor authentication
system will involve some extra cost, and for smaller organizations, that
can be restrictive. As there are so many options out there, the cost
increases can be minimized, so this need not rule out the
adoption of one of these systems. The cost of losing vital personal data and user accounts is often far higher than multifactor authentication will
ever cost[[1]](#references).

## Types of 2FA

### Hardware Tokens

Hardware tokens are small, like a key fob, and generate a new numeric code every 30-seconds, making them the most ancient form of 2FA. When users try to access an account, they glance at the device and enter the displayed 2FA code back into the site or app. Other hardware tokens automatically transfer the 2FA code when plugged into a computer's USB port.

They've got several downsides, however. For businesses, distributing these units is costly. And users find their size makes them easy to lose or
misplace. Most importantly, they are not entirely safe from being hacked[[9][10][11]](#references).

### SMS Text-Message and Voice-based tokens

SMS-based 2FA communicates with a user's phone directly. The site provides After obtaining their login and password, the user a one-time passcode (OTP) through a text message. After that, much like with the hardware token, the user must re-enter the OTP into the application to gain access.
Voice-based 2FA works similarly, automatically dialing a user and delivering the 2FA code audibly.

For a low-risk online activity, text or voice authentication may be
sufficient. However, this degree of 2FA may not be adequate for websites
that retain your personal information, such as utility providers, banks,
or email accounts. In addition, SMS is widely regarded as the least secure user authentication method. As a result, many businesses are strengthening their security by shifting away from SMS-based two-factor authentication[[9][10][11]](#references).

### Software Tokens

A software-generated time-based, one-time passcode (also known as TOTP, or  "soft-token") is the most popular kind of two-factor authentication (and a preferred alternative to SMS and voice).

A user must first download and install a free two-factor authentication
program on their smartphone or computer. The app can then be used with any site that accepts this type of authentication. The user first enters a
login and password, and then, when prompted, the code displayed on the app is entered. Soft tokens, like hardware tokens, are often valid for less
than a minute. Soft-tokens further eliminate the possibility of hacker
eavesdropping because the code is created and shown on the same device. With SMS or voice transmission techniques, this is a significant worry[[9][10][11]](#references).

### One Time Passwords

#### What is an OTP

A one-time password (OTP) is similar to a password; however, it can only
be used once. It is frequently used with a conventional password as a secondary authentication mechanism to provide additional protection.

One-time passwords do what they state and nothing more.
Once you've used a password, it's dumped, and you'll have to enter a
different one the next time you need to access that application. This
improves security and makes it far more difficult for undesirable actors
to access private accounts.
An OTP for a specific application or website can be accessed via smartphone apps, text messages, or a proprietary token (such as a key fob). OneLogin Protect is an example of an OTP generator that can be downloaded as a mobile app. You're utilizing an OTP when you get an SMS text with a code to assist you in logging in to a website or application.

OTPs are generated using several industry-standard methods, such as SHA-1. To produce the OTP code, these methods require two inputs: a seed and a moving factor. When you create a new account on the authentication server, the seed is a static value (secret key).

The movement factor changes each time a new OTP is required, although the seed does not. This is because forming the moving element differs between HOTP and TOTP[[1][2][3]](#references).

#### HOTP

![HTOP-image](/image/article_img/hotp.webp 'HTOP process visualized')

HOTP stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code, and the "H" in HOTP stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). In layman's words, the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) is an event-based OTP with a counter as the moving factor in each code.

The movement factor is incremented based on a counter each time the HOTP is requested and validated. The generated code is valid until you actively request another one and the authentication server validates it. Once the code is validated and the user is granted access, the OTP generator and the server are synchronized. Yubikey is an example of a HOTP-based OTP generator[[1][2][3]](#references).

#### TOTP

![TOTP-image](/image/article_img/totp.webp 'TOTP process visualized')

TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) is a time-based one-time password. TOTP uses a static seed, similar to HOTP, but the movement factor is time-based rather than counter-based.

A timestep refers to the length of time that each password is valid.
Timesteps are usually 30 seconds or 60 seconds in length. If you haven't
used your password within that time frame, it will expire, and you'll need
to request a new one to access your application[[1][2][3]](#references).

### Push Notification

Instead of relying on the user receiving and entering a 2FA token,
websites and applications can now send a push notification to the user
when an authentication attempt is made. The owner of the device simply
views the information and can authorize or refuse access with a simple
tap. It's a passwordless authentication system that doesn't require any
codes or additional interaction.

Push notification removes phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and
unauthorized access by establishing a direct and secure connection between
the store, the 2FA service, and the device. However, it can only be used
with an internet-connected device that can run apps. SMS-based 2FA may
also be a preferable fallback in places where smartphone penetration is
low or the internet is intermittent. Push notifications, on the other
hand, are a more user-friendly and secure type of security when it is
available.Instead of relying on the user receiving and entering a 2FA token,
