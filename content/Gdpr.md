## What is GDPR

The acronym GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR is a European security law that aims to protect the personal data of European citizens. This law applies to any European company that saves personal data from its users/clients.
The only exception to the GDPR is the processing of the Law Enforcement Directive. This process that GDPR does not cover is to protect national security.
GDPR compliance
Multiple aspects are necessary to be GDPR compliant. These include[1]:

* Lawful basis and transparency
* Data security
* Accountability and governance
* Privacy rights
Each of these topics consists of a few points that a company must meet to comply with the GDPR.

### Lawful basis and transparency

This topic mainly consists of non-technical points.
First on the list is to conduct an audit to determine what kind of data the company processes and which people have access to it. The importance of this audit is to have a list ready that showcases the processing of data in the company. Because of this list, it is easier to answer questions like; Which employees have access to this data, any third parties that have access, and when the company plans to erase this data (if possible).

Secondly, the company needs to have legal justification for why they need to process the data in question (this excludes data regarding children). In case that the legal basis is that the subject chose "consent," there are extra obligations, most notably giving the person the opportunity to revoke consent. If the justification is "legetimate interest," the company must show through a privacy impact assessment that this is indeed the case.

The last part required for "Lawful basis and transparency" is a privacy policy informing anyone about your data processing and legal justification.

### Data security

This topic discusses the steps necessary to comply with the data security part of the GDPR. Data security is like the previous point focused on non-technical steps that a company must undertake to comply with GDPR.

The first step necessary is to take the protection of data from the moment the development of the product begins. Furthermore, it is essential to follow the principles of "data protection by design and default." It is also crucial that the data protection principles from "Article 5" is obeyed during the development. The importance of this step is to ensure that the company and its employees are always aware of the security of the data they save/process.

Secondly, it is essential to use encryption, pseudonymization, or anonymize any personal data used within the company (wherever possible). For example, most companies use data from their users for metrics, training data, or any other kind of productivity tool. To protect people's privacy, the company needs to remove any identification of the data's origin. An example is changing all names, birthdays (except the year), and addresses (except the zip code). A randomized data generation algorithm is the fastest and most ethically correct way to do this work. The most important thing is to get accurate data without linking to the original identity of the user entering this data. This way, the company can use metrics or testing data to improve its products without compromising its users' data.

### Accountability and governance

Firstly there has to be a person responsible for ensuring that every part of the company complies with GDPR. This person will be accountable for the company regarding GDPR and evaluate the data protection policies and the implementation of those policies. The necessity of this role is to make sure that a person is actively checking the GDPR compliance in the company. Furthermore, this person will ensure that the company will not encounter any surprises in the future of any GDPR violations, resulting in substantial fines.
