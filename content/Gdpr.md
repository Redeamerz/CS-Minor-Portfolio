## What is GDPR

The acronym GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR is a European security law that aims to protect the personal data of European citizens. This law applies to any European company that saves personal data from its users/clients.
The only exception to the GDPR is the processing of the Law Enforcement Directive. This process that GDPR does not cover is to protect national security.
GDPR compliance
Multiple aspects are necessary to be GDPR compliant. These include[1]:

* Lawful basis and transparency
* Data security
* Accountability and governance
* Privacy rights
Each of these topics consists of a few points that a company must meet to comply with the GDPR.

### Lawful basis and transparency

This topic mainly consists of non-technical points.
First on the list is to conduct an audit to determine what kind of data the company processes and which people have access to it. The importance of this audit is to have a list ready that showcases the processing of data in the company. Because of this list, it is easier to answer questions like; Which employees have access to this data, any third parties that have access, and when the company plans to erase this data (if possible).

Secondly, the company needs to have legal justification for why they need to process the data in question (this excludes data regarding children). In case that the legal basis is that the subject chose "consent," there are extra obligations, most notably giving the person the opportunity to revoke consent. If the justification is "legetimate interest," the company must show through a privacy impact assessment that this is indeed the case.

The last part required for "Lawful basis and transparency" is a privacy policy informing anyone about your data processing and legal justification. By providing this information publicly, anyone interested can investigate what your organization does with the data received from users. This privacy policy must be easily accessible, transparent, and use plain and unambiguous language which anyone can easily understand.

### Data security

This topic discusses the steps necessary to comply with the data security part of the GDPR. Data security is like the previous point focused on protocols an organization must contain to comply with GDPR.

The first step necessary is to protect data from the moment the development of the product begins. Furthermore, it is essential to follow the principles of "data protection by design and default." It is also crucial that the data protection principles from "Article 5" is obeyed during the development. The importance of this step is to ensure that the organization and its employees are always aware of the security of the data they save/process.

Secondly, it is essential to use encryption, pseudonymization, or anonymize any personal data used within the organization (wherever possible). For example, most companies use data from their users for metrics, training data, or any other kind of productivity tool. To protect people's privacy, the organization needs to remove any identification of the data's origin. An example is changing all names, birthdays (except the year), and addresses (except the zip code). A randomized data generation algorithm is the fastest and most ethically correct way to do this work. The most important thing is to get accurate data without linking to the original identity of the user entering this data. This way, the organization can use metrics or testing data to improve its products without compromising its users' data.

The third security measure is to create an internal security policy for team members and build awareness about data protection. Humans are usually the weakest link within the security of an organization. Because of this weakness, employees must be well trained/knowledgeable about data security. A security policy can help ensure that the training and knowledge of your employees meet a specific standard. A few critical areas of knowledge that employees should possess based on the GDPR are email security, passwords, two-factor authentication, device encryption, and VPNs. Employees with higher access to things like personal data should receive extra training to ensure data security within the organization.

The fourth part focuses on knowing when to conduct a data impact assessment (privacy impact assessment) and having an internal process ready to work on this assessment. The GDPR requires organizations to do this kind of analysis anytime they want to use people's data in a way that could have a high risk to their rights.

Lastly, the GDPR requires organizations to have protocols ready to notify authorities and possible victims of a data breach. For example, when a data breach occurs which exposes personal data, your organization is required to inform the authorities (in your jurisdiction) within 72 hours. In addition, your organization must notify the people exposed by this breach so they can take precautions to protect other interests. For example, when the leaked data includes passwords, the victims can change their passwords if they reuse them somewhere else. The only exception is when you believe that the data breached poses no risk to the parties involved.

### Accountability and governance

This portion of the GDPR contains the rules to ensure that there is always someone accountable to ensure compliance with GDPR.

Firstly there must be a person responsible for ensuring that every part of the organization complies with GDPR. This person will be accountable for the organization regarding GDPR and evaluate the data protection policies and the implementation of those policies. The necessity of this role is to make sure that a person is actively checking the GDPR compliance in the organization. Furthermore, this person will ensure that the organization will not encounter any surprises in the future of any GDPR violations, resulting in substantial fines.

The second point is vital in case that one or multiple third parties process personal data on behalf of your organization. There has to be a data processing agreement if this is this case. This agreement has to be signed by your organization and the third party in question. This agreement states the rights and obligations of each party to comply with the GDPR.

The third part only applies to organizations stationed outside of the EU. If a non-EU company wants to process data regarding people from a member state is required to appoint an EU representative. The only exception to this is if the organization is a public authority or only occasionally processes data that has a low risk to the data protection rights of the people in question.

The last requirement is to appoint a Data Protection Officer if your organization falls into one of the circumstances mentioned by the GDPR. These circumstances include but are not limited to tracking people's location or behavior, systematically monitoring a publicly accessible place on a large scale, processing children's data, and processing data that could result in physical harm to the data subjects if leaked.
