		<h2 class="text-h4">Pros and Cons of 2FA</h2>
		<h3 class="text-h5">Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-h6">Second layer of security</li>
			<p>
				This is a self-evident statement, but it is also the most obvious
				benefit of using a two-factor authentication solution. While a password
				has been the standard method of security for almost as long as accounts
				have been required to be kept private in the digital age, it only
				provides one layer of protection.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a password is discovered, it is considered a security breach.
				Strong passwords have been advised for a long time, typically comprising
				a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, but they are
				still only one kind of security.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, more secure methods of accessing personal information, such
				as a speech recognition device, are only one layer that must be
				compromised.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Variation</li>
			<p>
				Only if you use a second password in the same way as the first will you
				see a 100 percent increase in security levels. Two-factor
				authentication, on the other hand, usually combines the authentication
				systems you use, resulting in much higher security levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other methods of achieving this, such as intrinsic authentication, which
				uses a physical property to identify you, are available in addition to
				using mobile devices to transmit on a security key (a tried-and-true
				two-factor authentication approach).
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Cost-effective</li>
			<p>
				In general, two-factor authentication methods are not expensive. If you
				add retinal scanning or voice recognition as a second step, the price
				will rise, but advances in these techniques mean that you can now use
				these types of hardware systems at relatively low costs.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="text-h5">Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-h6">Time</li>
			<p>
				Everything is relative when it comes to time. So, while the time it
				takes to access accounts using a two-factor authentication process may
				be negligible in terms of capacity for many, for others, such as using a
				card reader each time, it would be a wasteful process that, when
				multiplied by the number of employees, would equate to inefficient use
				of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some two-factor authentication systems, such as SMS, are faster to
				implement than others, so thorough research is advised if this is a
				concern. A two-step process will always take longer for the second step,
				so a two-step authentication system is unnecessary for data or accounts
				that aren't important.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">It's not foolproof</li>
			<p>
				The reality is that no security system is foolproof â€“ that is the nature
				of the cyber landscape right now. Two-factor authentication processes
				are certainly more effective than one-factor systems, that much is
				evident, but determined hackers can still implement any number of
				devious schemes and malware threats to undermine your system and access
				your sensitive data.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is not an easy feat to accomplish. The methods for circumventing or
				breaching two-factor authentication systems will vary depending on
				several factors, including the type of authentication system you use, as
				some are more effective than others. But while a password, for example,
				can be inadvertently shared, the same cannot be said of inherent
				recognition in two-step authentication.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cybercriminals have developed increasingly devious, underhand yet
				sophisticated hardware to copy this information to steal data and access
				accounts. Recent posts online show 2fa is far more secure than the
				alternatives however nothing is foolproof when it comes to
				cybersecurity.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Cost</li>
			<p>
				While relative to the organization, inevitably a two-factor
				authentication system will involve some extra cost, and for smaller
				organizations that can be restrictive. As there are so many options out
				there, the cost increases can be minimised, however, so this need not
				rule out the adoption of one of these systems. The cost of losing key
				personal data and user accounts is often far higher than multifactor
				authentication will ever cost.
