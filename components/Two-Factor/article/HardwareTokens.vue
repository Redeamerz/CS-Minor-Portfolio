		<h3 class="text-h5 mb-4">Hardware Tokens</h3>
		<p>
			Hardware tokens are small, like a key fob, and generate a new numeric code
			every 30-seconds, making them the most ancient form of 2FA. When a user
			tries to access an account, they glance at the device and enter the
			displayed 2FA code back into the site or app. Other versions of hardware
			tokens automatically transfer the 2FA code when plugged into a computer’s
			USB port.
		</p>
		<p>
			They’ve got several downsides, however. For businesses, distributing these
			units is costly. And users find their size makes them easy to lose or
			misplace. Most importantly, they are not entirely safe from being hacked.
