		<p>
			Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a security mechanism that
			needs two different forms of identification to gain access to something.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two-factor authentication can be used to make an online account, a
			smartphone, or even a door more secure. Before anything that is being
			secured may be accessed, 2FA requires two forms of information from the
			userâ€”a password or personal identification number (PIN), a code given to
			the user's smartphone, or a fingerprint.
