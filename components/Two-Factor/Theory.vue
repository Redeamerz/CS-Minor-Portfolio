		<h2 class="text-h4 mb-5">What is Two-Factor Authentication?</h2>
		<p>
			Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a security mechanism that
			needs two different forms of identification to gain access to something.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two-factor authentication can be used to make an online account, a
			smartphone, or even a door more secure. Before anything that is being
			secured may be accessed, 2FA requires two forms of information from the
			user—a password or personal identification number (PIN), a code given to
			the user's smartphone, or a fingerprint.
		</p>
		<h2 class="text-h4">Pros and Cons of 2FA</h2>
		<h3 class="text-h5">Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-h6">Second layer of security</li>
			<p>
				This is a self-evident statement, but it is also the most obvious
				benefit of using a two-factor authentication solution. While a password
				has been the standard method of security for almost as long as accounts
				have been required to be kept private in the digital age, it only
				provides one layer of protection.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a password is discovered, it is considered a security breach.
				Strong passwords have been advised for a long time, typically comprising
				a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, but they are
				still only one kind of security.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, more secure methods of accessing personal information, such
				as a speech recognition device, are only one layer that must be
				compromised.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Variation</li>
			<p>
				Only if you use a second password in the same way as the first will you
				see a 100 percent increase in security levels. Two-factor
				authentication, on the other hand, usually combines the authentication
				systems you use, resulting in much higher security levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other methods of achieving this, such as intrinsic authentication, which
				uses a physical property to identify you, are available in addition to
				using mobile devices to transmit on a security key (a tried-and-true
				two-factor authentication approach).
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Cost-effective</li>
			<p>
				In general, two-factor authentication methods are not expensive. If you
				add retinal scanning or voice recognition as a second step, the price
				will rise, but advances in these techniques mean that you can now use
				these types of hardware systems at relatively low costs.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="text-h5">Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-h6">Time</li>
			<p>
				Everything is relative when it comes to time. So, while the time it
				takes to access accounts using a two-factor authentication process may
				be negligible in terms of capacity for many, for others, such as using a
				card reader each time, it would be a wasteful process that, when
				multiplied by the number of employees, would equate to inefficient use
				of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some two-factor authentication systems, such as SMS, are faster to
				implement than others, so thorough research is advised if this is a
				concern. A two-step process will always take longer for the second step,
				so a two-step authentication system is unnecessary for data or accounts
				that aren't important.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">It's not foolproof</li>
			<p>
				The reality is that no security system is foolproof – that is the nature
				of the cyber landscape right now. Two-factor authentication processes
				are certainly more effective than one-factor systems, that much is
				evident, but determined hackers can still implement any number of
				devious schemes and malware threats to undermine your system and access
				your sensitive data.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is not an easy feat to accomplish. The methods for circumventing or
				breaching two-factor authentication systems will vary depending on
				several factors, including the type of authentication system you use, as
				some are more effective than others. But while a password, for example,
				can be inadvertently shared, the same cannot be said of inherent
				recognition in two-step authentication.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cybercriminals have developed increasingly devious, underhand yet
				sophisticated hardware to copy this information to steal data and access
				accounts. Recent posts online show 2fa is far more secure than the
				alternatives however nothing is foolproof when it comes to
				cybersecurity.
			</p>
			<li class="text-h6">Cost</li>
			<p>
				While relative to the organization, inevitably a two-factor
				authentication system will involve some extra cost, and for smaller
				organizations that can be restrictive. As there are so many options out
				there, the cost increases can be minimised, however, so this need not
				rule out the adoption of one of these systems. The cost of losing key
				personal data and user accounts is often far higher than multifactor
				authentication will ever cost.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="text-h4 mb-5">Types of 2FA</h2>
		<h3 class="text-h5 mb-4">Hardware Tokens</h3>
		<p>
			Hardware tokens are small, like a key fob, and generate a new numeric code
			every 30-seconds, making them the most ancient form of 2FA. When a user
			tries to access an account, they glance at the device and enter the
			displayed 2FA code back into the site or app. Other versions of hardware
			tokens automatically transfer the 2FA code when plugged into a computer’s
			USB port.
		</p>
		<p>
			They’ve got several downsides, however. For businesses, distributing these
			units is costly. And users find their size makes them easy to lose or
			misplace. Most importantly, they are not entirely safe from being hacked.
		</p>
		<h3 class="text-h5 mb-4">SMS Text-Message and Voice-based</h3>
		<p>
			SMS-based 2FA communicates with a user's phone directly. The site provides
			the user a one-time passcode (OTP) through a text message after obtaining
			their login and password. After that, much like with the hardware token,
			the user must re-enter the OTP into the application to gain access.
			Voice-based 2FA works similarly, automatically dialing a user and audibly
			delivering the 2FA code. It is still used in nations where cellphones are
			expensive or where cell connection is inadequate, despite its rarity.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a low-risk online activity, text or voice authentication may be
			sufficient. However, this degree of 2FA may not be sufficient for websites
			that retain your personal information, such as utility providers, banks,
			or email accounts. SMS is widely regarded as the least secure method of
			user authentication. As a result, many businesses are strengthening their
			security by shifting away from SMS-based two-factor authentication.
		</p>
		<h3 class="text-h5 mb-4">Software Tokens</h3>
		<p>
			A software-generated time-based, one-time passcode (also known as TOTP, or
			"soft-token") is the most popular kind of two-factor authentication (and a
			preferred alternative to SMS and voice).
		</p>
		<p>
			A user must first download and install a free two-factor authentication
			program on their smartphone or computer. The app can then be used with any
			site that accepts this type of authentication. The user first enters a
			login and password, and then, when prompted, the code displayed on the app
			is entered. Soft tokens, like hardware tokens, are often valid for less
			than a minute. Soft-tokens further eliminate the possibility of hacker
			eavesdropping because the code is created and shown on the same device.
			With SMS or voice transmission techniques, this is a major worry.
		</p>
		<h4 class="text-h6 mb-1">One Time Passwords</h4>
		<h5 class="text-subtitle-1 font-weight-bold">What is an OTP</h5>
		<p>
			A one-time password (OTP) is similar to a password, however, it can only
			be used once. It is frequently used in conjunction with a conventional
			password as a secondary authentication mechanism to provide additional
			protection.
		</p>
		<p>
			One-time passwords are exactly what they sound like one-time passwords.
			Once you've used a password, it's dumped, and you'll have to enter a
			different one the next time you need to access that application. This
			improves security and makes it far more difficult for undesirable actors
			to gain access to private accounts.
		</p>
		<p>
			An OTP for a certain application or website can be accessed via smartphone
			apps, text messages, or a proprietary token (such as a key fob). OneLogin
			Protect is an example of an OTP generator that can be downloaded as a
			mobile app. You're utilizing an OTP when you get an SMS text with a code
			to assist you to log into a website or application.
		</p>
		<p>
			OTPs are generated using a number of industry-standard methods, such as
			SHA-1. To produce the OTP code, all of these methods require two inputs: a
			seed and a moving factor. When you create a new account on the
			authentication server, the seed is a static value (secret key).
		</p>
		<p>
			The movement factor changes each time a new OTP is required, although the
			seed does not. The method by which the moving factor is formed is a
			significant difference between HOTP and TOTP.
		</p>
		<h5 class="text-subtitle-1 font-weight-bold">HOTP</h5>
		<p>
			HOTP stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code, and the “H” in
			HOTP stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). In layman's
			words, the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) is an event-based
			OTP with a counter as the moving factor in each code.
		</p>
		<p>
			The movement factor is incremented based on a counter each time the HOTP
			is requested and validated. The generated code is valid until you actively
			request another one and the authentication server validates it. Each time
			the code is validated and the user is granted access, the OTP generator
			and the server are synchronized. Yubikey is an example of a HOTP-based OTP
			generator.

		</v-container>
		<h5 class="text-subtitle-1 font-weight-bold">TOTP</h5>
		<p>
			TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) is a time-based one-time password.
			TOTP uses a static seed, similar to HOTP, but the movement factor is
			time-based rather than counter-based.
		</p>
		<p>
			A timestep refers to the length of time that each password is valid.
			Timesteps are usually 30 seconds or 60 seconds in length. If you haven't
			used your password within that time frame, it will expire, and you'll need
			to request a new one in order to access your application.
		</p>
		<h3 class="text-h4 mb-4">Push Notification</h3>
		<p>
			Instead of relying on the user receiving and entering a 2FA token,
			websites and applications can now send a push notification to the user
			when an authentication attempt is made. The owner of the device simply
			views the information and can authorize or refuse access with a simple
			tap. It's a passwordless authentication system that doesn't require any
			codes or additional interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Push notification removes phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and
			unauthorized access by establishing a direct and secure connection between
			the store, the 2FA service, and the device. However, it can only be used
			with an internet-connected device that can run apps. SMS-based 2FA may
			also be a preferable fallback in places where smartphone penetration is
			low or the internet is intermittent. Push notifications, on the other
			hand, are a more user-friendly and secure type of security when it is
			available.
