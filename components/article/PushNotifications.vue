		<p>
			Instead of relying on the user receiving and entering a 2FA token,
			websites and applications can now send a push notification to the user
			when an authentication attempt is made. The owner of the device simply
			views the information and can authorize or refuse access with a simple
			tap. It's a passwordless authentication system that doesn't require any
			codes or additional interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Push notification removes phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and
			unauthorized access by establishing a direct and secure connection between
			the store, the 2FA service, and the device. However, it can only be used
			with an internet-connected device that can run apps. SMS-based 2FA may
			also be a preferable fallback in places where smartphone penetration is
			low or the internet is intermittent. Push notifications, on the other
			hand, are a more user-friendly and secure type of security when it is
			available.
